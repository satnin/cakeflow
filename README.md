# Cakeflow
A subset of CakePhp like functionalities for Laravel ! 
You can use it to migrate smoothly 


# Installation

---

Run this command to install it via packagist

```bash
composer require satnin/cakeflow
```

# Config

After installation, you need to **work through these steps** to start using Cakeflow

### 1.  Register Cakeflow Service provider

````php
// bootstrap/providers.php
return [
    App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,
    //Add the line bellow
    \cakeflow\Providers\CakeflowServiceProvider::class
];
````

### 2.  Make your controllers extend Cakeflow Base controller

````php
// app/Http/Controllers/Controller.php 
abstract class Controller extends \cakeflow\Controllers\Controller
{
}
````

### 3.  Design your own component classes

````php
//  app/Http/Controllers/Components/MyComponent.php 
class MyComponent extends \cakeflow\Controllers\Components\Component
{
    public function startup(EventInterface|null $event = null)
    {
        // Startup logic here for example
    }
}
````

### 4.  Start implementing cake workflow in your controllers
````php
class TestController extends Controller
{
    public function initialize()
    {
        parent::initialize();
        $this->loadComponent(AuthComponent::class);
    }
    public function beforeFilter(\cakeflow\Dispatchers\Events\EventInterface $event)
    {
        parent::beforeFilter($event); // TODO: Change the autogenerated stub
    }
    public function beforeRender(\cakeflow\Dispatchers\Events\EventInterface $event)
    {
        parent::beforeRender($event); // TODO: Change the autogenerated stub
    }
    //...
}
````
